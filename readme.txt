This app is made by using create-react-app. It's made out of components, each component has its own styling using scss syntax. 
The app is compatible with all browsers and it has responsive design. The main "Offers today" banner images is taken dynamically 
and mapped using Open Weather Map API (https://openweathermap.org/api). The links in header, footer and side drawer (when on mobile) 
are active and they will go to static pages with some re-used components. Also there is automatically generated lorem ipsum text in all
of the static pages and a back button. By using react router and redux I stored the whole url path to state store and made button handler 
to manipulate the state according to the path that is currently active.
